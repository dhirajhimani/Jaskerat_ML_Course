11. GRAPHS FOR CATEGORICAL DATA
12. Examples
22. Interpreting Graphs with a Critical Eye
23. Symmetric, Right/Left skewed Graphs
54. MEASURES OF CENTER - Sigma_x_i which means ‚Äúthe sum of all the x measurements‚Äù
60. MEASURES OF VARIABILITY - standard deviation & variance
62. Explanation
66. ON THE PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STANDARD DEVIATION
67. Tchebysheff‚Äôs Theorem - Given a number k greater than or equal to 1 and a set of n measurements,
    at least [1  (1/k2)] of the measurements will lie within k standard deviations of their mean.

184. THE BINOMIAL PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION
186. If the sample size is large relative to the population size‚Äîin particular, if 
     n/N  .05‚Äîthen the resulting experiment is not binomial
