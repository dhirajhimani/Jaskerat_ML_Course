239 - Introduction
240 - Point Estimation

the statistic ˆ Θ = … ( ) h X , X , ,Xn 1 2 is called a point estimator of θ. Note that ˆ Θ is a random variable because
it is a function of random variables. After the sample has been selected, ˆ Θ takes on a particular
numerical value θ ∧ called the point estimate of θ.

241 - A point estimate of some population parameter θ is a single numerical value ˆθ of a
statistic ˆΘ. The statistic ˆΘ is called the point estimator.

242 Sampling Distributions and the Central Limit Theorem
A statistic is any function of the observations in a random sample.
The probability distribution of a statistic is called a sampling distribution

243 Central Limit Theorem

If X X Xn 1, 2,…, is a random sample of size n taken from a population (either finite or
infinite) with mean μ and finite variance σ2 and if X is the sample mean, the limiting
form of the distribution of
Z = ((X / n) −μ) / (σ/n^2) as n→∞, is the standard normal distribution.

using this formaul we calculate the z-score and see the table to calculate the P(X) on standard normal Distributions

249 - 251 - Variance of a Point Estimator

Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator - 
If we consider all unbiased estimators of θ, the one with the smallest variance is
called the minimum variance unbiased estimator (MVUE).

If X ,X , ,Xn 1 2 … is a random sample of size n from a normal distribution with mean μ
and variance σ2, the sample mean X is the MVUE for μ.
