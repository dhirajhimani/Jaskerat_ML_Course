This repository contains My daily notes and study material for the ML,

From Notebook, I mean .ipynb file

* Python  Basics
* Numpy Basics & Some intro to Classes and Objects
* Linked List
* Binary Tree and assignment
* Probability basics, and assignment Binomial Distribution Formula
* Books folder contains pages text, for important readings
* Added Notebook for distribution until now normal and binomial is covered
